### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, they did! I used the concept of the "tomato time starter" in Lab 3 to implement learn the basics of JS. The "event listener" funtionality also came in handy.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had enough time, I would add the "edit existing playlists" functionality. I would also add some more CSS Styling to it to improve UI/UX.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My demo worked as I planned. I pulled an all-nighter yesterday and went to bed at 3am. SOo I guess that helped out a lot.
